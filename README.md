# Should You Buy That?
🛒 A sentiment-based online judge for Amazon purchases.

Built with React, Jest, scikit-learn & Flask.

Given a link to a potential purchase, the application scrapes the product page for reviews, and undertakes sentiment analysis to determine the general consensus towards the product by previous buyers. Based on this, the application advises on the purchase (buy 👍🏾 or do not buy 🙅🏾‍♀️), whilst highlighting notable buyer reviews.
