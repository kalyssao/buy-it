# i've decided to use naive bayes here.
# in this file, i will preprocess and create a pipeline to run my inputs into
# then i will split the data into train & test sets,
# then figure out my metrics
# after which i will save the model.
# in decision.py i will load this model to make a prediction on a single item first.
