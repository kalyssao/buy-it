# Should I Buy It? - Backend

This is a flask server set up to allow for communication with the application frontend.

For a live demo, check out my website [here]().

The backend contains the route /should-i-buy-it, which is called when the user enters the link in the main page.

This route interacts with a web scraper, built using selectorlib, as well as a sentiment analyser, built using scikit-learn.

More details soon. Chat later.x
